# HTML5 Notebook

HTML5 introduces more descriptive **HTML tags**.

These include: 

* Main 
* Header 
* Footer 
* Nav 
* Bideo 
* Article 
* Section and others.

These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. 

The **main** HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.
